Project 1-1: Pentominoes phase 3 by Group 12

The program requires the user to have installed the library called "Java FX" on their computer.
After that is secured, the user should run the "GUI" class.
After a window opens, the user has to specify the dimensions of the cargo size and the count of ABC or LPT parcels. After the correct number of parcels has been written into the input field, the algorithm can be run by clicking one of the "Find solution" buttons.
The button at the top runs the search for a given set of ABC parcels only, while the button at the bottom runs the program for LPT parcels.

The user must install JavaFX and have the appropriate library settings to run this application.
